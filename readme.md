### Q: 1

# How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it includes all JavaScript features plus extras like static typing (e.g., defining numbers, strings). TypeScript code converts to JavaScript to run in browsers or Node.js. Its goal is to make code safer and easier to understand.

### How TypeScript Improves Code Quality

#### 1. Catches Errors Early
TypeScript checks for mistakes during coding. For example, it flags an error if you use a string where a number is expected, reducing bugs.

**Example**:
```typescript
let age: number = 25;
age = "twenty-five"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
```

#### 2. Better Code Clarity
TypeScript defines types for variables, functions, and objects, making code easier to understand. Types act like documentation for other developers.

**Example**:
```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

#### 3. Improves Team Collaboration
TypeScript’s type system ensures all developers follow the same data rules, reducing errors in team projects.

### How TypeScript Improves Project Maintainability

#### 1. Easier Refactoring
TypeScript makes code changes safer by warning if something breaks, allowing confident refactoring without introducing bugs.

#### 2. Supports Large Codebases
TypeScript’s types act like a map, helping developers navigate and update complex projects easily.

#### 3. Better Tooling Support
TypeScript integrates with editors like Visual Studio Code, offering auto-completion and error highlighting to speed up coding.

### Real-World Benefits
Companies like Microsoft and Slack use TypeScript to reduce bugs, speed up development, and improve teamwork. For example, it helped the VS Code team manage their codebase effectively.

### Why Use TypeScript?
TypeScript enhances code quality by catching errors early and improving clarity. It supports maintainability through safe refactoring, large codebase management, and better tools. It’s a great choice for teams and complex projects.

### Q: 2
# What is the use of enums in TypeScript? Provide an example of a numeric and string enum.

## What Are Enums?

Enums (enumerations) in TypeScript let you define a set of named constants, either numbers or strings. They make code more readable, reduce errors, and improve maintainability by giving meaningful names to fixed values.

## Why Use Enums?

- **Readability**: Enums replace unclear numbers or strings with descriptive names.
- **Error Prevention**: Enums limit values to a specific set, avoiding invalid inputs.
- **Maintainability**: Updating an enum value changes it everywhere it’s used.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures only valid enum values are used.

## Types of Enums

### 1. Numeric Enums
Numeric enums assign numbers to names, starting from `0` by default or using custom values.

**Example**:
```typescript
enum Direction {
  Up,    // 0
  Down,  // 1
  Left,  // 2
  Right  // 3
}

let move: Direction = Direction.Up;
console.log(move); // Output: 0

enum StatusCode {
  Success = 200,
  NotFound = 404,
  Error = 500
}

let response: StatusCode = StatusCode.Success;
console.log(response); // Output: 200
```

### 2. String Enums
String enums assign string values to names, ideal for human-readable text.

**Example**:
```typescript
enum Color {
  Red = "RED",
  Green = "GREEN",
  Blue = "BLUE"
}

let favoriteColor: Color = Color.Green;
console.log(favoriteColor); // Output: GREEN
```

## When to Use Enums?

- For fixed sets of values, like user roles or days of the week.
- To make code clearer and self-documenting.
- In team projects to ensure consistent use of values.

### Conclusion

Enums in TypeScript simplify code by providing named constants. Numeric enums work well for number-based values, while string enums are great for readable strings. Use enums to write clearer, safer, and more maintainable code.
